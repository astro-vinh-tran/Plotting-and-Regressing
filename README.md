Hi,

This is a project I worked on a long time ago. I worked on the program when I was teaching myself code and programing. It was one of my first experiences with python and numpy. 

Anyhow, the purposes of the program were to find the best fit lines and best fit polynomial functions (estimation of the real functions using Taylor's transformation) for given data sets. The input are the two files x.txt and y.txt (you could write your xs and ys into these files). After entering some parameters (or let the program decide for you), the result wil be printed into the reseult.txt file.

There are some others useful functions, try to discorver all of them. I DARE YOU.

The source code is open so everyone can check it out (and make suggestion if you have some time).

The program is quite efficient. However, the accuracy with periodic functions is ... questionable. Still, try it out. 

Feel free to use the code however you desire (I would be very happy if you put a little credit for me though ;) ).

Have fun,

Vinh Tran
